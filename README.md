# Automate your Flutter Releases

Use GitHub Actions to automate your Flutter app builds, testing & releases.

How to integrate it into your app?

- Create a GitHub repo and upload Application folder into it.
- Create a GitHub action for your repo & paste the contents of flutter-release.yml in .github/workflows/ from this repo.
- Tag your releases (mandatory)
- The builds will start on push/pull to master.
